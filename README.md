# fluid_sim
A simple fluid sim using pixi.js based on Jos Stam's article 'Real time fluid dynamics for games'.

The application can be run by creating a local server e.g. using Python or Windows Powershell. 

Clicking on the fan changes the base flow. Right clicking adds dye. Left clicking whilst dragging adds dye and disturbs the velocity field.
